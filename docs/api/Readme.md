# Multi-Payment Gateway NPM Package - Technical Architecture

## 1. Core Architecture

The package will follow an adapter pattern, where each payment gateway implements a common interface. This ensures a unified API while allowing for gateway-specific functionality.

### Key Components:

#### a. Base Interfaces

- `PaymentGateway`: Core interface that all gateway implementations must follow
- `PaymentRequest`: Common structure for payment requests
- `PaymentResponse`: Standardized response structure
- `TransactionDetails`: Common structure for transaction information
- `WebhookHandler`: Interface for processing gateway callbacks

#### b. Provider Adapters

Each payment provider (Paytech, Cinetpay, Money Fusion, etc.) will have its own adapter that implements the `PaymentGateway` interface, translating the unified API calls to provider-specific API calls.

#### c. Configuration Manager

Manages API keys, secrets, and environment variables for different payment providers.

#### d. Transaction Manager

Handles the lifecycle of payment transactions including creating charges, processing refunds, and managing subscriptions.

#### e. Error Handler

Standardizes error responses from different payment gateways into a common format.

#### f. Logging Service

Records transaction attempts, successes, failures, and other important events.

#### g. Webhook Manager

Processes and validates incoming webhook notifications from payment providers.

## 2. Flow Architecture

```
Application ----> Multi-Payment Gateway Package ----> Payment Providers
    ^                        |                            |
    |                        v                            v
    +---- Webhook Manager <--- <--- <--- <--- <--- <--- <-+
```

1. The application initializes the payment gateway with configuration
2. The application makes unified API calls to the package
3. The package translates these calls to provider-specific API calls
4. Responses are standardized and returned to the application
5. Webhooks from providers are processed by the Webhook Manager

## 3. Security Architecture

- API keys and secrets stored securely using environment variables
- JWT authentication for webhook validation
- Request/response encryption where supported by providers
- Data validation and sanitization for all inputs
- Rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse

## 4. Extensibility Model

New payment gateways can be added by:

1. Creating a new adapter class that implements the `PaymentGateway` interface
2. Registering the new adapter with the gateway factory
3. Implementing provider-specific validation and transformation logic

This approach allows developers to extend the package with minimal changes to the core codebase.
